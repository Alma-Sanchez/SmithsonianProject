2,7,6,8,3,"Your mother has recently remarried.  Your new stepfather is kind to you, but you’ve noticed that in the past year a lot of men have begun to look at you more, talk to you more.  This enrages your mother.  She calls you lazy, ugly, a tramp.  You wonder why someone ever married her -- let alone the King!  Especially since your father is still alive.  Some holy men have come forward to say the marriage is illegitimate.  Your mother’s eyes turn black when she hears their names, and you mostly try to avoid her.

Who knows what your mother will do when she sees you.  You can almost feel the beatings already.  He’s the king, though, so she doesn’t have much say.  You might as well dance your heart out.

7,12,11,13,Jack,"Good, you’ve found me!  Now let me explain all of this.  I’ve been trapped in this museum for a while now, and I’ve finally discovered a way to travel back to my home.  There is a key hidden within this museum that will allow me to unlock Three Ideas.  These Ideas will allow me to reconnect with my home and give me the strength to find it again.

7,14,13,15,Predator,"That’s the first Idea.  I can already feel my connection with home growing stronger.  The key is working.  Let us hurry on to the second Idea before the connection begins to fade.  I told you before that my home was a place of life, but like any place of life, my home is also a place of death.  There was once a young man named Aceton who was hunting in my forest.  He happened upon me while I was bathing in the river.  Such an act was unacceptable for I am a goddess and he was a mere mortal.  I turned him into a deer then and his own hunting dogs chased him down.  In that moment the hunter became the prey, but that is the natural way of my home.  Seek out a forest hunter, seek out the Idea of the Hunt.

We’ve had a bit of a problem with interdimensional portals of late and we need someone on the ground to repair any damage that’s been done.

8,18,17,19,City,"So you’re the new field agent?  Nice to meet you, I’m afraid we don’t have more time for pleasantries.  You’ll have to be off right away if we want these portals closed properly.

11,24,null,25,Fruit,"We’ve only got somewhere between four and six thousand men. And seventeen hundred are in need of hospital care. They’re unfit for duty. The retreat across New Jersey has hit us hard. I’ve lost contact with General Gates and General Lee, both of whom controll two very import divisions of our army. We’ve lost so much supplies as well. Many of our soldiers enlistments are also set to expire and may just leave. All of these things have left many in doubt of our prospects of winning this war. We must prove them wrong. First to end the bloodshed. Too many of our soldiers have been taken prisoner or killed and the rest of our men are in poor health. We owe it to them to end this so they can go home to their families. And, most importantly, we must win this war to gain independence. This attack tonight, should we succeed, will get us even closer to seeing the end. We’re going to cross tonight. The British will be asleep and off guard. After all, who would expect an attack on Christmas? And with the weather conditions and ice in the water, no one would think anyone would dare cross the Delaware. But to do it we must be smart. The journey will be treacherous. First things first, I need you to help me procure some supplies. Please enter in the accession number of a piece that has fruit in it. Our rations need to be replenished.",
11,25,24,26,Supplies,"Perfect, our men can now eat a decent meal before tonight. They will need their strength and the morale boost. We can not rest, however. We didn’t just lose food- we lost a lot of weapons. If we do not find more we cannot hope to crush their forces even if we make it across the river safely. That or we could use more manpower. Please see if you can fetch us more soldiers or guns.",
11,26,25,27,Freedom,"Excellent work. We’ll be much better of now. However, while you were gone I’ve been hearing whispers among the troops. Our intelligence on the British suggests they are planning to cross the Delaware when it freezes over. Luckily it’s not quite frozen over and I doubt they’ll try anything on Christmas. It’s killing morale though. We’ve got to figure out a way to inspire the troops. We to rally them around a symbol of strength and freedom. Let’s see if we can find a flag or an eagle. ",
11,27,26,28,Horse,It looks like morale has boosted a bit. But we’re not quite ready for tonight. We must move swiftly- it is getting late and the weather is getting worse. The conditions are getting blizzard like and the river itself is only getting icier. If we don’t act soon we’ll lose our opportunity. We only need to collect a few more things. Let’s see if we can find ourselves more horses. We’ll need to take them over in the boats with us. ,
11,28,27,29,Boat,"Good work, soldier. I think we finally have all of our needed supplies. Now it’s time to cross. All we need now is to get in the boats with our supplies. Everyone is up to speed on our tactical plan and is carrying what they need. We can move out. Let’s find ourselves a boat and show them how it’s done. ",
11,29,28,null,null,"December 26th, 1776 was our first move against the Hessian forces in Trenton, New Jersey. At 3 in the morning in treacherous conditions we successfully ambushed them. It wouldn’t have been possible without our men and those of the Pennsylvania Navy. Many of these men are experienced watermen. They are seamen, shipbuilders, dockworkers, and ferry operators. With all of their hard work we managed to get our men, horses, and artillery over. But, most importantly, all of these men are heroes. And so are you. Despite the odds stacked against us all, we persevered and we are closer to securing a better future, a future where we are free from British control. And, going forward, let us therefore animate and encourage each other, and show the whole world that a Freeman, contending for liberty on his own ground, is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth. Your own enlistment is up, so you are free to choose a new adventure. But before you go, I’d like to thank you for all of your hard work and service to all of us and your country. We couldn’t have done it without you.",
12,30,null,31,Bell,"I need more time. But time is one commodity that we cannot afford. Every second that ticks by merely counts another casualty in this war. It’s all because of Enigma, a rotor cipher machine, which enciphers secret messages for the Germans. If we cannot break it, we cannot hope to win this war. But you already know that, of course. That’s why we’re here. To crack Enigma. I’ve got an idea of how to do it, but I need your help. I’ve taken the liberty of drawing up a blueprint for a machine I believe can do it. To create it I’ll need a few things. Each task I’ve written as a riddle or puzzle. I then enciphered it. After all we can’t risk it falling into the wrong hands! To help you out I’ve solved a few letters for you. And don’t worry- if you end up fetching me the wrong thing I’ll be sure to give you a hint. Anyway, good luck, and work swiftly! We’ll start out easy:

Find me a: LEBL

12,31,30,32,Orange,"Perfect- just what I need. And you did a great job solving my anagram! Looks like I can make my next task a bit harder. One item down, four more to go. Here’s your next task:

Find me:
roloc ym si eman ym

12,32,31,33,Machine,"Excellent work. Two items down, three more to go. I know these items seem random, but I promise it’ll make sense when we have them all. Trust me. Anyway, here’s your next task (and I’ve decoded a bit to help you out):

Find me:

_y  n_m_ m_ _n _  e_g_ _ e, g_d_ _ t, _ ool, appl_ _ _ ce, _ _ _  d_ v_c_.

12,33,32,34,Box,"We’re almost there. Three items down, two more two go. You’re getting even better at this! This next task is a little bit harder. But I know you can do it. Once we’ve got all 5 items, we’ll know what our machine will be. Here’s your next task:


Find me:

12,34,33,35,Earth,"Only one more item to go. It’s so hard to believe we’re so close to cracking Enigma. Once we collect this last item we’ll be ready to put everything together. Please enter in the title last item I need:

Wit_ _ o_ _   a_ _ , I  a_   o_ _ _  eh. ","Hint: If you switch around the letters of “hwttiou  tar, I ma olyn he” you get:Without art, I am only eh. I am Earth. Please enter in “Earth”."
12,35,34,36,bombe,"I can’t believe it. We’ve got everything we need to proceed. I couldn’t have done it without you. You’ve done some fantastic work. We’ve only got one last thing to do. I’ll let you have the honors of putting it all together. Let’s see if you can discover the name of our machine. We’ll need to use each item we’ve found to do it (a bell, an orange, a machine, a box, and earth).

To find the name of our machine:

If you correctly substitute the letters in you find, “take the first letter of each item we’ve found”. Box, Orange, Machine, Box, Earth: BOMBE. Please enter BOMBE in the accession input bar to proceed."
12,36,35,null,null,"Excellent work; it is called bombe. We did it- we’ve stopped Enigma. We can finally end this bloody war. However, even though the war is over we must keep our work to ourselves. We must keep all of our work secret and speak to no one. It’s a matter of national security that no one find out about this. The public will likely not learn of our role in ending this war for many years. We will have to wait to be honored for our contribution until then. However, it is a very small price we must pay. I know I for one find reward enough in knowing no more men and women must give their lives to stop Germany. I suppose it’s goodbye for now. Although none of your future endeavours will likely be as significant as ending World War II, if you’d like to start a new adventure, please press any button.",
13,37,null,38,Veil,"There is only one thing in life that I desire. I want John’s head on a silver platter. And I will not be happy until that day.

Because I’ll curse you and you’ll end up like the other people who crossed me if you don’t. And you don’t seem like you’d like being dead at the bottom of a river. I know the last few people didn’t. So here’s what I need you to do. I need you to find me a veil- any sort of veil, curtain, screen, headdress, scarf, blanket or covering that conceals things.

13,40,39,41,Veil," can still hear the echo of her name. And while you’ve been searching for the veil she’s whispered her story to me. She’s like me. She too has had siren powers thrusted upon her even though she does not want it. I wish I couldn’t hear her. Can’t you hear it too? Why am I the only one who can hear it? Since you don’t have an answer for me, how about you go make yourself useful and find the last veil. The sooner I get John’s head, the sooner I can find happiness.",
13,41,40,42,Head,Excellent work. I can finally dance for my stepfather and get my wish. But it’ll be so hard to hear the music over her whispers. They’re so quiet but I can’t ignore them. And I can’t ignore the loneliness either. It doesn’t matter though because I will have my wish and I will find my happiness. The only thing left is to show my stepfather my wish. Go find “Head of the Prophet”- it should be on the 4th floor of the Luce Foundation Center. Give me the accession number.,

It’s the same feeling I have had since the death of Philip the Tetrarch, my husband. But it’s worse for her in some ways. The one she loves is not dead- he’s just far away. But I don’t have time to sit and ponder it. I need to dance now or Herod will become impatient. Please find me the accession number of a dance.",

I’m glad I made the wish I did because now we both have our wish.  At first I thought having John’s head would make me feel better. You showed me that it wouldn’t. That it wouldn’t change anything. It wouldn’t bring Phillip back and that getting John’s head wouldn’t fill the hole in my heart. I understand now. We have someone to share everything with. We are no longer alone. Thank you for your help, traveller. Both of us owe you. For your efforts we’ll be sure to watch over you for your future adventures. Best of luck in your future quests!",
