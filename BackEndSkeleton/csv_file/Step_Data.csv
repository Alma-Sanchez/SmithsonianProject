1,1,1,"The dust settles as the final echoes of the battle fade.  You stand up from behind the pillar you’ve been pressed behind for the better part of the last hour.  There’s carnage all around you.  About ten feet away what’s left of your commander lays intermingled with the zombie that you took out just seconds too late.  It doesn’t take long to realize you’re the only survivor.  You pull out your handheld radio, but you get nothing but static.  You have to seek higher ground.",,,
1,2,2,"You set off toward the ruins of what you think used to be a business school.  As far as most buildings go, this one is in pretty good condition.  As you approach you notice a few of the doors still have glass in them.  There’s a number embossed on them. Enter that number to move forward.",,,
1,3,3,The transmission crackles through: “Field team 6 survivors.  Field team six survivors.  Do not abort mission.  Repeat do not abort.  Medical supplies  needed at base.  Do not abort. Complete Mission and report to base in…….” You hesitate.  Should you follow orders or worry about your own survival?,,,
1,4,4,"You didn’t fight through a horde of zombies just to die getting supplies.  You decide to head for the base.  You glance out at the overgrown quad.  There must be at least 50 zombies milling about.  They havn’t noticed you.  Yet.  The sparcest area seems to be the building across from you, with the tattered banners that seemed to have once read SPA. (part of you wonders why a college had a spa building.)  You decide to make a run for it, planning to use one of the pillars as cover.  Pick a pillar by entering the letter on the pillar’s banner. (S,P, or A)",,,
1,5,5,"You duck behind the pillar, safe for now.  You check your transmitter again. This time you hear: “...do not abort.. Complete mission and report to base in Battelle…”   You glance across the quad.  It looks like there’s a relatively clear path straight across.  You run for it passing a large stone sign in the process.  Enter the last word on that sign to move forward",,,
1,6,6,"You duck behind the pillar throwing your last knife into the eye socket of the zombie that was right on your heels.  You think for a moment that you’re safe.  Then you run straight into the zombie that had been napping behind the pillar.  You scramble backward as the zombie attacks.  You manage to fend off the creature, but it’s a close call.  You pull out your transmitter quickly, hoping more information will filter through. “...do not abort.  Complete mission and report to base in Battelle…”  You look across the quad and see that there’s a pretty clear path to Battelle.  You run for it, passing a large stone sign i the process. Enter the first word on that sign to move forward.",,,
1,7,7,"You sprint into Battelle, slamming the door shut behind you.  A check point bars you from the entrance to the base.  You find it rather comical that such an intimidating sight is next to such a strange statue.  Enter what type fo animal the statue is to move forward.",,,

1,9,9,"You get to the atrium, clearing the checkpoint without difficulty.  You arrive to the initial excitement of the survivors. So few people made it, that they let you in even thought you failed to get the medical supplies.   It’s only later that night that you start to feel dizzy.  That’s when you notice the tear in your jacket.  That’s when you notice the bite. And without a doubt you know it’s too late.  Your last thought before you fall unconscious is that you’re about to become a hungry zombie in the middle of a group of unsuspecting, sleeping people... [END]",,,
1,10,10,"You reach the atrium after clearing the checkpoint and are received with a warm welcome...until you admit you didn’t pick up the medical supplies.  You settle in, happy to be alive, until the new commander tells you you’ll be going out on a last ditch supplied run the next day.  You don’t think this could possibly get worse, until she tells you that you’re the bait…[END]",,,

1,12,12,"It is easy enough to get into the building.  You find the supplies right where they were supposed to be.

1,16,16,"You check your transmitor again, but there's still a lot fo static.  All you hear is ""…Survivrors…abort…base…Battelle""  From that it sounds like you could head straight for the base.
