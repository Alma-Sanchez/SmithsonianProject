1,1,1,"We’ve only got somewhere between four and six thousand men. Seventeen hundred are in need of hospital care. The retreat across New Jersey has hit us hard. I’ve lost contact with General Gates and General Lee, both of whom control two very import divisions of our army. Our supplies are dangerously low and many of our soldier’s enlistments are also set to expire and may just leave. All of these things have left many in doubt of our prospects of winning this war. However this attack tonight, should we succeed, will get us even closer to seeing the end of this war. But with the weather conditions and ice in the water, crossing the Delaware will be dangerous. I need your help to lead us to victory. We only have time for at most 3 actions before I must lead my men across the Delaware. The longer we wait the harder it will be to cross. What do you think we should do? Should we secure rations, find more boats, or should we cross now? (Enter in “rations”, “boats”,  or “cross”.)",,,
1,2,2,"Good idea. Our food supply is low and getting good will not only boost our men’s energy and health, but will boost their morale. Roesen and Searle both have fruit. Maybe you can find one of the names of the fruits of their labor on this floor? (Enter in the title of the artwork.)",,,
1,3,3,"Boats it is. I fear that without boosting morale first this is a risky decision. However, if you’d like to continue, there are plenty of boats in the east wing on the second floor. To collect those boats, you’ll need to enter in their names. (Enter in the title of the artwork which contains a boat. If you no longer want to go get boats, enter in “go back”.)",,,
1,4,4,"After announcing to your men that it was time to cross, many left the camp, never to return. Your remaining men were too few to man the boats with and you were forced to abort the mission. To accept this outcome enter in “accept”. To try again and reject this outcome enter in “reject”.",,,
1,5,5,"Excellent job! Our men will now have something to eat. Morale around the camp has already boosted and they are less hungry. However, we still have lots to do before tonight. What do you think we should do? Should we find more food, find boats, boost morale, or should we cross now? (Enter in “rations”, “boats”, “morale”, or “cross”.)",,,
1,6,6,"You managed to find boats, but while you were out looking for supplies, many men have deserted. Without proper food and care, the war had become too much for many brave soldiers. Washington’s army has grown too small to cross. Would you like to give up? Or do you want to start over?",,,
1,7,7,"Boosting morale is important. Without it we cannot hope to succeed. Why don’t you come find me? I’m standing on the east wing of the second floor. To get my attention, you’ll have to enter in the year the statue of me resigning my commission was created.",,,
1,8,8,"o Good thinking! Since our men are now healthier and happier, we’re better prepared to prepare for our mission. Albert Pinkham Ryder makes fine waterscapes and boats. Can you find one of his works on the east wing on the second floor? (Enter in a title of one of his pieces located in the east wing on the second floor.)",,,
1,9,9,"I’m not so sure this is a good plan. However, if you want to proceed, we’ll need to get more food. The food in this east wing has been depleted. However, if you find the artists who hold food in the south wing of this floor, we’ll be able to add to our rations. (Enter in the artists name or “go back” if you’ve changed your mind about finding food.)",,,
1,10,10,"Although all soldiers were better fed, without proper boats and motivation, the icy Delaware was too much. Washington’s army was forced to turn back. Unfortunately, we were no match for the elements this time around. Do you admit defeat? Or do you want a redo? (Enter in “admit defeat” or “redo.)",,,
1,11,11,"Excellent work. Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have obtained possession. I have managed to convince my men as such. It is imperative we strike tonight when they are off guard to prevent them from further lodging into our home. Now that we have inspired our men, what should we do next? Find food, secure boats, or should we cross now?",,,
1,12,12,"Our men are now less hungry and now have proper boats. What should we do now? It’s far too dark to go out searching for food or boats. Should we work to boost morale, or should we cross now?",,,
1,13,13,"Our food supply has increased but so many of our men deserted. Without good boats to cross, many believe that this would be unnecessarily risky- and on Christmas Eve no less. We’ll have to abort our mission since we have so few men. Do we abort? Or do we try again? (Enter in “abort” or “try again”.)",,,
1,14,14,"I’m not so sure we should find more food. Our men’s morale is high, but without proper supplies it will be a difficult journey to cross the Delaware. However, if you’d like to continue, could you find the fruit that is with the morning glories? It should be on this floor if we travel south.",,,
1,15,15,"Good thinking. Now that are men are less hungry and morale is up, all we have left to do is finish getting supplies. Can you find a picture of a boat? ",,,
1,16,16,"Our men were strong, inspired, but we lost many men in our journey across the Delaware. We sprung upon the British and we have turned the tides of this war. Although our outcome was not ideal, we should take time to bask in our victory this Christmas day. Thank you for your help. We couldn’t have done it without you.",,,
1,17,17,"Go find washington",,,
1,18,18,"With stronger boats and marginally less empty stomachs, Washington’s army rowed across the Delaware. The elements deterred many men from crossing, but although the army was not at full capacity, we remained victorious. With your guidance, the tides of this war have turned. Washington couldn’t have done it without you guidance and has given you highest honors for your work.",,,
1,19,19,"The fresh melon boosted the morale of Washington’s army even higher. But the night has grown late and they were forced to cross without amply supplies. As they sailed across the Delaware Washington’s army fought to stay alive. Many lives were lost, but eventually they managed to cross despite their rickety boats and ambush the British. Although many lives were lost, Washington couldn’t have done it without your help. This victory has turned the tides of the war. This Christmas day we’ll have much to celebrate.",,,
