8,31,null,32,Find a piece of art which evokes feelings of a deeply human experience.,"Hello, I’m Edith Wilson. I was married to Woodrow Wilson, 28th president of the United States. From the outside, my terms as First Lady seems completely ordinary. But from the inside, well, that’s a different matter entirely. Come with me in this quest to unlock the mystery of my story. I will never forget when I first met Woody. It was 1915 and I had been invited to the White House for tea with my good friend Helen Woodrow Bones. Woody had just come in from playing golf and I dare say he was enchanted with me. After many invitations to dinner, automobile rides, and trips on the Potomac on the presidential yacht, Woody told me he fancied me. I even took up golf to spend time with dear Woody. When I finally allowed him to propose, he said, “in this place time is not measured by weeks, or months, or years, but by deep human experiences…”

8,34,33,null,Find a work of art which features a woman with a secret.,"I was called a “Presidentress” and “Acting First Man” and am still sometimes referred to as the “Secret President” or “First Lady President.” Even if I were the first presidentress, history is rife with other women working behind the scenes.

10,49,null,50,Nature,You currently sit in a forest with your companion Clover Adams.  It is your responsibility to escort him on his quest.  Night begins to descend and the king of pop advises you that it may be wise to stop and build a fire.,,
10,50,49,51,Muse,You now return with plenty of firewood to keep warm for the night.  As you sit down and tend to the fire you notice something odd: the smoke plumes rising from your campsite merge together to create the image of a skull.  You look to Clover to see if she noticed the skulls as well and you observe a very worried look on his face.  She hurriedly tells you to go find the muses as they may have some answers.,,
10,51,50,52,Null,"You tell the Clover Adams that while foraging for wood you came across a great tree spirit that said it had the power to spare the world from the apocalypse.  However, it has been angered by the way mankind has treated the environment.  Clover trusts your judgement and tells you to try to appeal to the tree spirit. ",,
10,52,51,53,Horse,You return to Clover Adams to ask for guidance on tracking down these animals. Clover Adams begins to explain that the tree spirit contacted her and that the first animal that needs to be saved is a mystical horse.,,
10,53,52,54,Bull,"You find the horse and after a short struggle you are able to rein the horse in and mount it. You ride your new companion back to the campsite.  “Great you found the horse!” Clover Adams says. “Now, I hope you brought something red because we need to find our Bull.”",,
10,54,53,55,TV,"Once you find the bull, it begins to charge at you.  You quickly dodge out of the way injuring your leg in the process. The wound is not serious, but you will not be able to run.  As the bull charges at you once more to finish the job, you feel a warm sensation rush through your body and galloping in your ears.  The horse that you saved earlier has come to your aid and knocks the bull over. You watch the bull and horse stare each other down as if silently communicating. Almost like magic, the bull dips its head and you have the sudden feeling it is now on your side.  After receiving the aid of the bull and horse, there remains one more animal.

Clover Adams tells you that the tree spirit wants to see you personally for this final quest.  As you re-enter the forest where you first met the spirit, the spirit begins to speak to you.  The spirit says that this final animal represents the very strength of the world and must be protected at all costs.  In order to better protect it, the tree spirits shows you illusory images of this mythical creature.",,
10,55,54,56,Zoo,Ah that’s right! Its called a Quadrop.  Its a very rare animal.  It has a weird name if you ask me though. It sounds old to.  Its probably all bones by now.,,
10,56,55,null,null,"Pleased with your devotion to protecting the environment the tree spirit decides to lend you its power.  A flash of light blinds your vision as wake up next to a campfire with Clover Adams seated opposite you.  As you stir and your vision becomes clear you notice the smoke rising off of the campfire.  You tense up thinking that a skull will appear in the campfire, but instead the shape of a leaf begins to emerge.  The Clover Adams smiles as she suggests you both get rest for the journey tomorrow.
